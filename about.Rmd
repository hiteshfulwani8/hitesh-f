### Introduction and Interests: 

Writing introductions and bios can be daunting. Therefore, despite having some experience with writing in varied contexts, it is difficult escape the nervous introspection that is endemic to this process. Perhaps, it might never go away so it is always better to get on with it. 


Despite having other wide-ranging interests, my core area of focus, since high-school, has been Economics. The process which led to the cultivation of this interest has been extremely enriching and cannot be encapsulated here, given the constraints of this space. However, I will suffice it to say that the substantial contributing factor throughout this process has been my interaction with people whose guidance/advise has cultivated a lifelong curiosity about the discipline. This fascination and an innate desire to understand the process of long-term economic growth and development morphed into a decision to major in Anthropology and Development from the London School of Economics (LSE). This curiosity about the functionig of systems, and the how humans behave, has now morphed into a decision to apply these lessons to the world of Finance, Strategy, and Operations.
